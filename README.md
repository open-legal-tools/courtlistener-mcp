# Claude Meets CourtListener

> AI-powered legal research and judicial opinion generation system

## Quick Start

This project creates an AI system that can write judicial opinions in the style of specific Indiana judges, particularly Judge Foley from the Indiana Court of Appeals.

### Current Status
**Phase 1 Complete ✅** - Training data collection and style analysis  
**Phase 2 Ready 🔄** - Model training in Google Colab

## What We've Built

### 📚 **Training Dataset**
- **26 comprehensive training examples** ready for Google Colab
- **12 authentic Judge Foley opinions** from 2020-2025
- **Style-specific examples** covering citation patterns, quotation integration, and procedural writing

### 🎯 **Judge Foley Style Captured**
- **Direct introductions** with clear case statements
- **Chronological fact organization** with appropriate detail
- **Strategic citation placement** following Bluebook standards
- **Professional judicial tone** with procedural clarity

### 🛠️ **Tools Created**
- **Opinion collector** - Extracts judge-specific writings from CourtListener
- **Style analyzer** - Identifies writing patterns and characteristics  
- **Training generator** - Creates targeted examples for model learning

## Files Overview

### **Ready for Training**
- `comprehensive_foley_training.txt` - **Import this into Google Colab**
- `comprehensive_foley_training.py` - Python format training data

### **Documentation**
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Detailed project status and achievements
- `judge-foley-style-guide.md` - Complete style guide for Judge Foley's writing

### **Analysis Results**
- `priority_judges_training.json` - Original collected judicial text
- `foley_style_detailed_analysis.json` - Statistical style analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Open Google Colab** (free tier recommended for cost control)
2. **Upload** `comprehensive_foley_training.txt`
3. **Run training** using the provided examples
4. **Test generated text** against authentic judicial writing

## Key Innovation

This is the first systematic analysis of individual judicial writing styles using AI, focusing on:
- **Citation integration patterns**
- **Procedural clarity requirements**
- **Appellate Rule 22 compliance**
- **Bluebook citation standards**

The training data teaches the model not just what to write, but how specific judges write, including their signature patterns and professional preferences.
