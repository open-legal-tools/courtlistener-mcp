# Claude Meets CourtListener: AI Legal Research Project

## Project Overview
An AI system that integrates Claude with CourtListener's legal database to conduct legal research and generate judicial opinions in the style of specific Indiana judges, particularly Judge Foley from the Indiana Court of Appeals.

## Current Status: Training Data Collection Phase ‚úÖ

### üéØ **Primary Goal Achieved**
Successfully collected and analyzed Judge Foley's judicial writing style to create training data for AI model fine-tuning.

### üìä **Data Collection Results**
- **19 total training examples** from real judicial opinions (2020-2025)
- **12 examples specifically authored by Judge Foley**
- **7 examples from Indiana Supreme Court**
- **26 comprehensive training examples** including style-specific patterns

### üîç **Style Analysis Completed**
Detailed analysis of Judge Foley's writing patterns:

#### **Introduction Patterns**
- Direct case statements: "The State has charged..." / "[Defendant] appeals..."
- Clear procedural posture with upfront conclusions
- Average sentence length: 17.4 words (concise, readable)
- Formal party designations and precise issue framing

#### **Facts and Procedural History Approach**
- **Chronological organization** with specific temporal markers
- **Moderate detail level** - essential facts without excessive elaboration
- **Strategic citation use** - minimal record citations in introductions
- **Clean narrative flow** prioritizing readability

#### **Citation and Bluebook Compliance**
- **Indiana case format**: [Volume] N.E.[2d/3d] [Page] ([Year])
- **Record citations**: App. Vol. [#], p. [#] (used strategically)
- **Efficient short citations**: Strategic "Id." usage
- **Citation density**: 0.0 per 100 words in introductions (clean style)

#### **Quotation Integration**
- **Paraphrasing preference** over direct quotation in case summaries
- **Seamless integration** when quotes are necessary
- **Clear attribution** with formal language ("contends," "argues," "maintains")

## üóÇÔ∏è **Files Created**

### **Training Data**
- `comprehensive_foley_training.txt` - Ready for Google Colab training
- `comprehensive_foley_training.py` - Python format for easy import

   - Record citation patterns
   - Quotation integration
   - Bluebook compliance
   - Chronological organization
   - Foley signature patterns
   - Appellate Rule 22 compliance

### üéØ **Style Elements Captured**
- **Procedural clarity** - Direct openings with clear conclusions
- **Citation strategy** - Minimal clutter, strategic placement
- **Sentence structure** - Economical language, clear transitions
- **Professional tone** - Authoritative but accessible
- **Appellate Rule 22 compliance** - Proper jurisdiction and party identification

## üöÄ **Next Phase: Model Training**

### **Ready for Google Colab**
- Training data formatted for immediate use
- Examples include both authentic judicial text and style-specific training
- Meta-instructions teach the model WHY certain patterns are used

### **Training Objectives**
1. **Generate introductions** in Judge Foley's style
2. **Write Facts sections** with proper citation integration
3. **Create legal analysis** with appropriate quotation usage
4. **Produce conclusions** with clear dispositions
5. **Maintain Bluebook compliance** throughout

## üîß **Technical Architecture**

### **Data Sources**
- **CourtListener API** - Real judicial opinions from 2020-2025
- **Indiana Court of Appeals** - Primary source for Judge Foley examples
- **Indiana Supreme Court** - Additional training examples

### **Processing Pipeline**
1. **API Search** - Query for judge-specific opinions
2. **Text Extraction** - Extract plain text from judicial opinions
3. **Author Identification** - Pattern matching for judge authorship
4. **Style Analysis** - Extract specific writing patterns
5. **Training Generation** - Create targeted training examples

### **Quality Metrics**
- **Citation density analysis** - Optimal citation placement
- **Sentence length analysis** - Readability metrics
- **Pattern recognition** - Judge-specific writing signatures
- **Compliance checking** - Appellate rules and Bluebook standards

## üí° **Project Innovation**

### **Unique Contributions**
1. **Judge-specific style analysis** - First systematic analysis of Indiana judicial writing patterns
2. **Training data methodology** - Combines authentic text with targeted style examples
3. **Citation integration patterns** - Detailed analysis of record citation usage
4. **Procedural clarity focus** - Emphasis on appellate procedure compliance

### **Legal Tech Applications**
