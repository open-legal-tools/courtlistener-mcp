# Claude Meets CourtListener

> AI-powered legal research and judicial opinion generation system

## Project Overview

**Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ** - An AI system that writes judicial opinions in the style of specific Indiana judges, particularly Judge Foley from the Indiana Court of Appeals.

**Originally planned:** Claude integration with MCP features for legal research on CourtListener  
**Successfully delivered:** Comprehensive training data for AI model fine-tuning to generate judge-specific judicial opinions

## Current Status
**Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ** - Training data collection and style analysis  
**Phase 2 Ready üîÑ** - Model training in Google Colab

## What We've Built

### üìö **Training Dataset**
- **26 comprehensive training examples** ready for Google Colab
- **12 authentic Judge Foley opinions** from 2020-2025
- **Style-specific examples** covering citation patterns, quotation integration, and procedural writing

### üéØ **Judge Foley Style Captured**
- **Direct introductions** with clear case statements
- **Chronological fact organization** with appropriate detail
- **Strategic citation placement** following Bluebook standards
- **Professional judicial tone** with procedural clarity

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tools Created**
- **Opinion collector** - Extracts judge-specific writings from CourtListener
- **Style analyzer** - Identifies writing patterns and characteristics  
- **Training generator** - Creates targeted examples for model learning

## Files Ready for Use

### **Training Data**
- `comprehensive_foley_training.txt` - **Import this into Google Colab**
- `comprehensive_foley_training.py` - Python format training data

### **Documentation**
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Detailed project status and achievements
- Complete style guide for Judge Foley's writing patterns

## Quick Start

1. **Open Google Colab** (free tier recommended for cost control)
2. **Upload** `comprehensive_foley_training.txt`
3. **Run training** using the provided examples
4. **Test generated text** against authentic judicial writing

## Key Innovation

This is the first systematic analysis of individual judicial writing styles using AI, focusing on:
- **Citation integration patterns** (App. Vol., R., Tr. citations)
- **Quotation usage and attribution** (seamless integration, paraphrasing preference)
- **Procedural clarity requirements** (Appellate Rule 22 compliance)
- **Bluebook citation standards** (Indiana case and statute formats)

The training data teaches the model not just what to write, but how specific judges write, including their signature patterns and professional preferences.

## Technical Specifications

**Tech Stack Delivered:** Node.js, CourtListener API integration, Python training data  
**Target Audience:** Appellate judicial clerks and legal writing professionals  
**Integration:** Ready for Google Colab model training
